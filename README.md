To run locally you will need to create a .env file in the root of the repository and add the record:

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Deployment
When changes are pushed to the main branch the pipeline is initialised and the repository gets pushed to the live developement URL ([https://yellow-94486.web.app](https://yellow-94486.web.app/))
